# Security Policy

For responsible disclosure of security issues, please follow the instructions laid out in this document.

## Supported Versions

Generally, only the latest public version of our code has continued support. If a critical vulnerability is found in the current version, we may opt to backport any patches to previous versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please submit your vulnerability reports to security@trilogymp.com.

## Bug Bounties

We have no rewards for reporting vulnerabilities at this time due to our minimal overall budget, but we wish this to change in the future.
